## Dependencies
This code requires the following: python 3.*, TensorFlow v1.4+



## Data Generation
To access the datasets (i.e., samples_target64_1036_2.mat and samples_source64_1552_2.mat), please click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17WBUbbqnLbUjTuMuGNgnddwCx5Uw_q0H?usp=sharing).<br>
Although the orginal output files (i.e., *.p2m) are too large to be uploaded,  we provide the DataPreProcess.py  to demonstrate the datasets generation for readers' convenience。   
More questions about the data generation, please contact: yyw18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn.
